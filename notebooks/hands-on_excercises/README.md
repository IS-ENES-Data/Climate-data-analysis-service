In this hands-on we will find, analyze and visualize data from our DKRZ data pool. The goal is to create two  maps, which visuaize the number of tropical nights for 2020 and for a chosen year in the future. In order to achive this, the hands-on will be split into two excercises:

# Excecise 1

## `1_hands-on_find_data_intake.ipynb`

- Search for an appropriate list of datasets. The datasets should contain the variables `tasmin` on a daily basis.
- Save your selection as .csv file, so it can be used by another notebook.

# Excercise 2

### `2_hands-on_tropical_nights_intake_xarray_cmip6.ipynb`

- Read the saved selection and open the two files, which are needed.
- Calculate the number of tropical nights for both years.
- Visualize the results on a map. You can use your prefered visualization package or stick to the example in the demo `use-case_frost_days_intake_xarray_cmip6.ipynb`.
