Please, choose the Python 3 unstable kernel on the Kernel tab above, it contains all the common geoscience packages. See more information on how to run Jupyter notebooks at DKRZ [here](https://www.dkrz.de/up/systems/mistral/programming/jupyter-notebook). Find there how to run this Jupyter notebook in the DKRZ server out of the Jupyterhub, which will entail that you create the environment accounting for the required package dependencies. Running this Jupyter notebook in your premise, which is also known as [client-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side) computing, will also require that you install the necessary packages on you own but it will anyway fail because you will not have direct access to the data pool.
